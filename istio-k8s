Instructions - 
Our company has an application sitting in a Kubernetes environment, and we need to implement routing rules for it. We will need to log into the Kubernetes environment and deploy Istio. Once Istio is in place, we will deploy the application and verify that routing rules are being applied correctly.

Part A  - Deploy Istio into a Kubernetes Cluster and Deploy the bookinfo Application

1. Get the Istio installation package onto the Kube Master and unpack it:

$ wget https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/download/1.0.6/istio-1.0.6-linux.tar.gz
$ tar -xvf istio-1.0.6-linux.tar.gz

2. Add istioctl to our path:

$ export PATH=$PWD/istio-1.0.6/bin:$PATH

3. Set Istio to NodePort at port 30080:

$ sed -i 's/LoadBalancer/NodePort/;s/31380/30080/' ./istio-1.0.6/install/kubernetes/istio-demo.yaml

4. Bring up the Istio control plane:

$ kubectl apply -f ./istio-1.0.6/install/kubernetes/istio-demo.yaml

5. Verify that the control plane is running:

$ kubectl -n istio-system get pods

note- When all of the pods are up and running (which we can verify by running that command again) we can move on.

6. Install the bookinfo application with manual sidecar injection:

$ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f istio-1.0.6/samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml)

7. Verify that the application is running and that there are 2 containers per pod:

$ kubectl get pods

note- Ignore the busybox pod, that's part of the environment.

8. Once everything is running, let's create an ingress and virtual service for the application:

$ kubectl apply -f istio-1.0.6/samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml

note- Verify the page loads at the uri http://<kn1_IP ADDRESS>:30080/productpage


Part - B 

Verify That Routing Rules Are Working by Configuring the Application to Route to `v1` Then `v2` of the `reviews` Backend Service

1. Set the default destination rules:

$ kubectl apply -f istio-1.0.6/samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all.yaml

2. Route all traffic to version 1 of the application and verify that it is working:

$ kubectl apply -f istio-1.0.6/samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-all-v1.yaml

3. Update the virtual service file to point to version 2 of the service and verify that it is working. Edit istio-1.0.6/samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-all-v1.yaml (using whatever text editor you like) and change this:

from - 

- destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
        
to

- destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
